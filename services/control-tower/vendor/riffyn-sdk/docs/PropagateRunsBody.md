# PropagateRunsBody

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**path** | **list[str]** | A valid &#x60;activitiesOrder&#x60; array from one of the the &#x60;v1/experiment/{id}/run-paths?start&#x3D;{startActivityId}&amp;end&#x3D;{endActivityId}&#x60; response items. This is an array of activity &#x60;_id&#x60;s, in order, between the start and end activities (steps). Run-paths requires a start and stop activity ids in the query. The array will be validated against the same list that&#x27;s generated by the &#x60;v1/experiment/{id}/run-paths&#x60; response, to ensure the path is available. Must have at least 2 activities.  | 
**run_ids** | **list[str]** | An array of Run &#x60;_id&#x60;s from the starting activity (step) that you want to propagate. &#x60;v1/experiment/{id}/run-group/{id}/runs&#x60;  | 
**direction** | **str** | Indicates the direction the runs should be propagated. Only &#x60;downstream&#x60; is available, at this time. | [optional] 
**upstream_run_group_id** | **str** | The &#x60;_id&#x60; of the upstream run group that the &#x60;runIds&#x60; belong to. If not provided uses default run group. | [optional] 
**downstream_run_group_id** | **str** | The &#x60;_id&#x60; of the downstream run group that you&#x27;d like to propagate the runs to. Use the &#x60;/v1/experiment/{id}/run-groups?activity&#x3D;{activityId}&#x60; endpoint to get the list of run groups for the downstream activity (step), the last value of the &#x60;path&#x60;. If not provided uses default run group.  | [optional]
